## What Is PhantomFS?

PhantomFS uses the **Windows Projected File System (ProjFS)** to surface a virtual directory full of convincing decoy files — financial reports, SSH keys, API credentials, HR spreadsheets, NDAs — that exist only in memory. No data is ever written to disk until an attacker (or insider threat) opens one.

The moment a file is touched, PhantomFS:

- Writes a **Windows Event Log** entry (Application log, source `PhantomFS`)
- Fires a **Toast notification** to the active desktop session
- Logs the exact filename, timestamp, and process context

Because legitimate users have no reason to open files they didn't put there, every alert is high-confidence. No tuning, no ML, no cloud dependencies — just a native Windows driver and a single executable.

---

## Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Zero-footprint decoys** | Files are projected on demand — nothing is written to disk unless an attacker reads a file |
| **Windows Event Log** | Event ID 1001 (file read), 1002 (placeholder created), 1003 (started), 1004 (stopped) |
| **Toast alerts** | Immediate desktop notification via Windows PowerShell — works even over RDP |
| **Configurable templates** | PDF, XLSX, DOCX, JSON, CSV, PEM, plain text — all served from XML templates in the config |
| **Per-file cooldown** | Configurable throttle (default 15 s) prevents alert floods when a tool reads multiple chunks |
| **Synthetic file list** | Drop-in XML list of convincing filenames with realistic byte sizes |
| **Single executable** | `PhantomFS.exe` + `PhantomFS.exe.config` — no installer required |

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 1809 (Build 17763) or later — Windows 11 recommended
- .NET Framework 4.8
- **Windows Projected File System** optional feature enabled
- Administrator privileges to start the virtual root

---

## Quick Start

```powershell
# 1. Enable ProjFS (one-time, requires reboot)
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Client-ProjFS -NoRestart

# 2. Run PhantomFS (requires Administrator)
.\PhantomFS.exe --virtroot C:\Users\PhantomFS --syntheticonly
```

---

## Configuration

All settings live in `PhantomFS.exe.config`.

### `<settings>` Section

```xml
<settings>
  <add key="enableEventLog"       value="true"  />
  <add key="enableToast"          value="true"  />
  <add key="alertOnOpen"          value="true"  />
  <add key="alertOnRead"          value="true"  />
  <add key="toastCooldownSeconds" value="15"    />
  <add key="verbose"              value="false" />
  <add key="virtRoot"             value=""      />
  <add key="sourceRoot"           value=""      />
  <add key="syntheticOnly"        value="true"  />
</settings>
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enableEventLog` | `true` | Write to Windows Application event log |
| `enableToast` | `true` | Send desktop Toast notification |
| `alertOnOpen` | `true` | Alert when a placeholder is first created (directory browse) |
| `alertOnRead` | `true` | Alert when file data is actually read |
| `toastCooldownSeconds` | `15` | Minimum seconds between Toasts for the same file path |
| `verbose` | `false` | Extra console output for diagnostics |
| `virtRoot` | _(arg 1)_ | Override virtual root path from config rather than command line |
| `sourceRoot` | _(empty)_ | Optional real backing directory — leave empty for synthetic-only mode |
| `syntheticOnly` | `true` | Serve only the files listed in `<syntheticFileList>` |

### Adding Decoy Files

Add entries under `<syntheticFileList>` in the config:

```xml
<syntheticFileList>
  <folder name="\Documents">
    <file name="Q4_Financial_Report_2024.pdf"    size="8192"  template="pdf"  />
    <file name="Employee_Salaries_2024.xlsx"     size="4096"  template="xlsx" />
    <file name="Board_Meeting_Notes.docx"        size="6144"  template="docx" />
  </folder>
  <folder name="\IT\Keys">
    <file name="deploy_key.pem"                  size="3247"  template="pem"  />
    <file name="github_pat.txt"                  size="93"    template="github_pat" />
  </folder>
</syntheticFileList>
```

### Adding Content Templates

```xml
<fileContentTemplates>
  <template name="my_custom">
    <![CDATA[
      ... your file content here ...
    ]]>
  </template>
</fileContentTemplates>
```

---

## Event Log Reference

Open **Event Viewer → Windows Logs → Application** and filter by source `PhantomFS`.

| Event ID | Level | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1001 | Warning | A decoy file's data was read |
| 1002 | Warning | A decoy file placeholder was created (file was browsed/stat'd) |
| 1003 | Information | PhantomFS started — virtual root path logged |
| 1004 | Information | PhantomFS stopped cleanly |

---

## CI/CD — GitHub Actions

PhantomFS ships a workflow at `.github/workflows/build.yml` that compiles for **x64** and **ARM64** in parallel, and publishes a GitHub Release on every version tag.

### Triggering a release

The workflow runs manually from the Actions tab. Set the **version** input and tick **Publish a GitHub Release** to cut a release in one step:

```powershell
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Release assets will be named `PhantomFS-v1.0.0-x64.zip` and `PhantomFS-v1.0.0-arm.zip`.

---

## Building from Source

```powershell
# Requires .NET Framework 4.8 SDK or Visual Studio Build Tools
csc.exe /platform:x64 /r:System.Xml.dll /out:PhantomFS.exe src\PhantomFS.cs
```

`csc.exe` is typically at:
```
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe
```



## Deployment Ideas

- **Workstation trap** — run as a scheduled task at logon; any lateral movement to `\\hostname\PhantomFS\Virtual` fires an immediate alert
- **File server canary** — place a `\Finance` share pointing at the virtual root alongside the real finance share
- **Developer machine** — surface fake AWS keys and SSH keys in `~\Documents`; insider or supply-chain attacks trigger alerts before exfiltration

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] SIEM / syslog forwarding (CEF format)
- [ ] EVTX → JSON webhook (Teams / Slack integration)
- [ ] Configurable alert email via SMTP
- [ ] Auto-block via Windows Firewall on alert
- [ ] GUI management console
- [ ] ARM64 support

---

## Sponsorship

PhantomFS is free, open-source, and MIT-licensed. If it has saved you time — or caught a real attacker — please consider sponsoring continued development.
